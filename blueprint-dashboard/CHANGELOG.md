## V20 — Edit/Delete Notes, URL Auto-Linking, Setup API, Email Fix (2026-05-21)

Major UX improvements to staff notes, activity feed, email configuration, and data portability.

**Improvement #20 — Self-Service Database Setup API**
- Created `api/setup.js` with 5 actions:
  - `GET ?action=status` — connection status + table row counts
  - `POST ?action=test` — latency test
  - `POST ?action=migrate` — full migration SQL (9 tables + indexes + triggers + RLS)
  - `GET ?action=export` — complete data export
  - `POST ?action=import` — full data import with upsert
- Super Admin only access

**Improvement #21 — Staff Note Edit & Delete**
- ✏️ **Edit** button on each note (hover to reveal)
  - Inline textarea replaces the note body (no browser `prompt()`)
  - Save / Cancel buttons with Ctrl+Enter and Escape shortcuts
  - "edited" marker shown after editing
- 🗑️ **Delete** button on each note (hover to reveal)
  - Inline red confirmation bar (no browser `confirm()`)
  - "Delete this note?" with Delete / Cancel buttons
  - Animated fade-in on confirmation bar
- All feedback via `rcToast()` notifications (no more `alert()`)
- Applied to both **Staff Notes** (tracker) and **Activity Feed** (progress)

**Improvement #22 — URL Auto-Linking**
- URLs in staff notes auto-converted to clickable `<a>` tags
- URLs in activity feed messages auto-linked
- All links open in new tab (`target="_blank"`)
- CSS: link styling with underline, brand color, break-all for long URLs

**Progress API — Edit & Delete Support**
- `PUT /api/progress` — edit a progress update message
- `DELETE /api/progress?id=<id>` — delete a progress update
- `db.js`: added `deleteProgressUpdate()` and `updateProgressUpdate()` functions

**Email Configuration Fix**
- Merged duplicate "API Configuration (Resend)" card into single "Email Configuration" section
- Single API key input (`settingsResendKey`) now serves all purposes
- Removed duplicate `settingsResendApiKey` element and all references
- **Verify Connection**, **Send Test Email**, and **Check Usage & Quota** now auto-save settings before calling the API
- Added domain mismatch detection: warns if From Email domain doesn't match verified Resend domain
- Improved error parsing: Resend JSON errors shown as clean human-readable messages
- Added helpful placeholders: `Rockcrete USA Blueprint`, `noreply@yourdomain.com`, `re_xxxxxxxxxxxx`
- Added explanation text with link to resend.com/api-keys
- Restored Check Usage & Quota button + stats panel (API Key Status, Key Type, Daily Limit, Monthly Limit)

**Data Export Upgrade**
- Export now includes ALL 9 tables (was missing `tracker_state`, `teams`, `team_members`, `tasks`)
- Password hashes included in export for full portability
- Version bumped to V20

**UX — Modern Inline Interactions**
- Replaced all `prompt()`, `confirm()`, `alert()` with:
  - Inline textarea editor with Save/Cancel
  - Inline red confirmation bar with Delete/Cancel
  - `rcToast()` notifications for all feedback
- CSS: `.tc-inline-edit`, `.tc-delete-confirm` with animations
- Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+Enter to save, Escape to cancel

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed `BLUEPRINT_PASSWORD` references — variable removed (unused after user management system)
- Fixed TDZ crash: `let` → `var` for `TRACKER_DATA` / `TRACKER_STATE` to prevent "Loading..." hang
- Fixed Save/Cancel button readability: solid brand color background + dark text
- Cleaned up embedded git repo and cookies.txt from tracking
- Added `.gitignore` entries for `rockcreteusa/` and `cookies.txt`

**Knowledge Base**
- Created 10 comprehensive AI agent documentation files in `knowledge-base/`
- Updated `CHANGELOG.md` with complete V20 release notes
- Updated API reference with new Progress PUT/DELETE endpoints
- Updated known issues with resolution status

## V17_A — User Login & Profile System (2026-05-20)
